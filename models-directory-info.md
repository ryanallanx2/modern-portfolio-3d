# 3D Models Directory

This directory should contain the 3D models for the house viewer.

## Required Models

1. `modern_house.glb` - A modern style house model
2. `traditional_house.glb` - A traditional style house model

## Where to Find Models

You can download free 3D models in GLB format from:

1. [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&q=house)
2. [Poly Pizza](https://poly.pizza/category/buildings)
3. [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free/house)

## Optimization Tips

- Keep file sizes under 5MB for better performance
- Use models with reasonable poly counts (10k-50k triangles)
- Ensure models have proper materials and textures
